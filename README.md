# Patterns and Transformations - (Creative-Coding)
-------------------------------------------
Instructions:

Move mouse left to condense circles, right to spread circles.

-------------------------------------------
Description:

I started with the making the lines like in the example that we did in
class, but I thought it would be cool to create objects along those lines instead
of just lines itself, so I started spawning circles along the lines that
were created. 
I noticed that at a specific angle all of the scattered circles
would line up for a brief second, so I adjusted it so the angle would go back
and forth making it line up in a line every couple seconds. 
I think it looks cool because when the mouse is held to the left, it is very clustered but if held to
right it is very scattered, but regardless all of the circles come together into
a single line which is very cool. The way that it stutters and moves reminds
me a little of claymation.
